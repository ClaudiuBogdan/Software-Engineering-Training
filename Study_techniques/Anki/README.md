# What is **Anki**?
 **Anki** is a tool I found on Internet while I was looking for the most *effective* and *efficient* techniques to *learn new topics*. It's based on **space repetition** concept and it turns out that it's working (Science :sunglasses:). Anki is an open source project (here is the [link](https://github.com/dae/anki)) and is highly customizable.
