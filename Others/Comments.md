## Commenting your code serves multiple purposes, including:
- **Planning and Reviewing**: When you are developing new portions of your code, it may be appropriate to first use comments as a way of planning or outlining that section of code. Remember to remove these comments once the actual coding has been implemented and reviewed/tested:
- **Code Description**: Comments can be used to explain the intent of specific sections of code:
- **Algorithmic Description**: When algorithms are used, especially complicated ones, it can be useful to explain how the algorithm works or how it’s implemented within your code. It may also be appropriate to describe why a specific algorithm was selected over another.
- **Tagging**: The use of tagging can be used to label specific sections of code where known issues or areas of improvement are located. Some examples are: BUG, FIXME, and TODO.

## Tips
1. Keep comments as close to the code being described as possible. Comments that aren’t near their describing code are frustrating to the reader and easily missed when updates are made.
2. Don’t use complex formatting (such as tables or ASCII figures). Complex formatting leads to distracting content and can be difficult to maintain over time.
3. Don’t include redundant information. Assume the reader of the code has a basic understanding of programming principles and language syntax.
4. Design your code to comment itself. The easiest way to understand code is by reading it. When you design your code using clear, easy-to-understand concepts, the reader will be able to quickly conceptualize your intent.
